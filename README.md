## Graph formation
### Static embedding
encapsulates the static attributes of an entity, yielding a representation that remains invariant over time

### Dynamic Embedding - Out
signifies the potential influence an entity may impart upon its linked entities

### Dynamic Embedding - In
quantifies the influence that an entity receives from its associated entities,reflecting the cumulative impact of these relationships on the entity

## Embedding Training Algorithm
two steps, embedding first then influence matrix

## Graph function
